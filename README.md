# FacGNN
In Graph Neural Networks, the propagation and aggregation of node information often face limitations due to document length and scarcity of vital information. To overcome this shortcoming, this paper proposes a Graph Neural Network called FacGNN, that integrates multiple information factors for Automatic Text Summarization tasks.
